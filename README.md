## Description:
This component can help your Single Video make smoothlty loop playback all the time.
<br>It's so handy and pretty small playback function, also I will make use of redesigning more fun plugin.
<br>In some extend, the function of loop playback I inspired from Adobe Premimere.

## Functionality
- **File**
  - Import video what you want to play, of course support single one.
- **Play**
  - It can control playback whether run or not.
- **Duration**
  - Set cross time, it depend on the video time and 
  - (Unit: 60Frame/sec)

## Issue Known:
- It can't load the list of parameter in EngineComp.
- The plugin only can work for referring parameters to as interface instead of panels as interface.
- The buttons of the **AddComp** and **RemoveAll** position are not correctly.
- **RemoveAll** button doesn't remove all COMP rows at once.

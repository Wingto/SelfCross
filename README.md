## Description:
This component can help your Single Video more smoothly and naturally loop playback all the time.
<br>In some extend, the function of loop playback I inspired from Adobe Premimere.
<br>It's so handy and pretty small playback function, also I will make use of redesigning more fun plugin.

## Functionality
- **File**
  - Import video what you want to play, of course support single one.
- **Play**
  - It can control playback whether run or not.
- **Duration**
  - Set cross time, it depend on the video time and when you want to cross
  - (The function of this parameter is to start switching seconds before the end of the video)


## Issue Known:
- Video can't swithch if the value of "Duration" over the sum of video time.

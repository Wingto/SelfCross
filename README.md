  <br>Here I developed a software which support different media sources, including image and video. Its main features is that switch more natural between each other via fade in and fade out, in order to make feel good user experience. Additionally when it come to detect error source, the software can skip them and remind user which one got error, enhancing the stable for performance.
  <br>The software apply to the large screen and long-term performance or advertisement
